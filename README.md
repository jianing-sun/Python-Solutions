# Python practice everyday

A personal python practice process

1. A solution for Tic Tac Toe game. A two player game made by Python with simple syntax.
Just for fun. Finished on Dec 3rd, 2017.
2. A fibonacci generator. Finished on Dec 8th, 2017.
3. Prime factorization. Good hints from geekpradd. Thanks! Finished on Dec 8th, 2017.

Feel free to test the .py files and I would be very appreciated if you can comment with any bugs/suggestions to make it better.
Thanks!

One python a day, makes hairs away. ;)
